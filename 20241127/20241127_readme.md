# Things to note here
Original Idea was to do an interesting map project for the mapping challenge

## Tiles
I experimented with the tiles in here: 
- You can adjust the color of the tiles through the styles.css
- the selector is .leaflet-tile {...} 
- use the filter paramter to change things. 
    - you can for example change the hue with "hue-rotate(90deg)" -> adjust the degree how you like
